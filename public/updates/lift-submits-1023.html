                <h1>LIFT Submits Form 1023 to IRS for 501(c)(3) Status</h1>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on <span class="post-date">July 3, 2025</span></p>
                <p>We are thrilled to announce that the Literacy & Innovation in Financial Technology Alliance (LIFT) has officially filed Form 1023 with the Internal Revenue Service to seek recognition as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt public charity. This is a major step toward our goal of providing accessible, high-quality financial technology education to the public.</p>
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Achieving 501(c)(3) status is a critical milestone that will affirm our commitment to operating in the public interest. It will allow us to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accept Tax-Deductible Donations:</strong> This status will enable us to receive tax-deductible contributions from individuals and foundations, providing the resources needed to expand our educational curriculum and outreach programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Formalize Our Public Service Mission:</strong> Recognition from the IRS formally establishes LIFT as an organization dedicated exclusively to charitable and educational purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build Public Trust:</strong> Operating as a registered 501(c)(3) organization holds us to a high standard of transparency and accountability, which is essential for building trust with the communities we serve.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What's Next?</h3>
                <p>The IRS review process can take several months. During this time, our volunteer team will continue to work diligently on developing new educational modules and expanding our free resources. Our commitment to providing neutral, fact-based information remains our top priority.</p>
                <p>For those interested in the details of our application, we have made the full, unredacted filing available on our <a href="/governance.html">governance page</a>.</p>
                <p>We are incredibly grateful for the early support we have received and are excited about the future of LIFT. We will provide further updates as they become available.</p>
                <p>Thank you for being a part of our journey.</p>
