                <h1>LIFT Officially Creates Nonprofit Corporation</h1>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted on <span class="post-date">June 13, 2025</span></p>
                <p>We are excited to announce that the Literacy & Innovation in Financial Technology Alliance (LIFT) is now officially recognized as a nonprofit corporation in the State of Texas! Our formation documents were filed and accepted by the Texas Secretary of State, and our entity now appears in the <a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/account-status/search/32100643694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Comptroller's public records</a>.</p>
                <h3>How We Did It</h3>
                <p>We filed our Certificate of Formation as a nonprofit corporation through the Texas Secretary of State, using <a href="https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/nonprofit/texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northwest Registered Agent</a> as our registered agent. The filing fee was $65, and we received confirmation of our filing and entity status shortly after submission.</p>
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legal Recognition:</strong> LIFT is now a legally recognized nonprofit corporation, which is a key step toward our mission of providing accessible, high-quality financial technology education.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Our status can be verified by anyone through the Texas Comptroller's website, ensuring public trust and accountability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> With our Texas nonprofit status in place, we are now eligible to apply for federal 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status and continue building our educational programs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thank you to everyone who has supported us so far. We are excited to continue our journey as an official nonprofit and look forward to sharing more updates soon!</p>
