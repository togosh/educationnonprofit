        <section class="key-takeaways">
          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Blockchain-based governance:</strong>
              A DAO is a digital organization run by rules written into blockchain code,
              with no single leader. Every major decision is made by community vote.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Member voting with tokens:</strong>
              Governance tokens act like voting shares in a cooperative—holders can submit
              proposals and cast votes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency and automation:</strong>
              All votes and transactions are public on the blockchain.  
              Approved actions execute automatically through smart contracts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Global, open participation:</strong>
              Anyone with an internet connection and the DAO’s token can take part in governing the group.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Innovative but experimental:</strong>
              DAOs unlock new ways to organize and fund projects, yet the technology is still young
              and carries significant risks.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- ---------- WHAT IS A DAO? ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>What Is a DAO?</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>decentralized autonomous organization</strong> (DAO) is an online, community-led
            group whose rules and treasury are managed by smart contracts on a blockchain.
            Instead of a CEO or board, members collectively propose and vote on actions.
            When a proposal passes, the code enforces it exactly as written.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of a DAO like a digital cooperative or club—essentially a “group chat
            with a shared bank account.” The chat rules are locked in code, and every expense
            requires a vote.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- ---------- HOW DAOS WORK ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>How DAOs Work</h2>
          <img src="images/module8_daovoting.jpg" alt="Diagram showing members → proposals → voting → smart-contract execution" class="blockchain-diagram-image">
          <p>
            Most DAOs issue <strong>governance tokens</strong>.  Each token typically equals one vote,
            though some DAOs weigh votes differently.  Any member—or members who meet certain
            criteria—can post a proposal.  A proposal might request funds for a project,
            change a system parameter, or hire a service provider.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the voting period, members cast their votes from their crypto wallets.
            If the proposal meets the required threshold (for example, a simple majority and a
            minimum turnout), the DAO’s smart contract automatically executes the decision—
            releasing funds, changing settings, or updating rules—without human intervention.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>MakerDAO –</strong> Token holders manage parameters of the DAI stablecoin system,
              such as collateral requirements and stability fees.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ConstitutionDAO –</strong> A temporary DAO formed in 2021 that raised over $40 million
              from thousands of contributors to bid on a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- ---------- ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>Advantages and Challenges of DAOs</h2>

          <h3>Advantages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Decentralized power:</strong> No single person can dictate outcomes; decisions are shared among token holders.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Budgets, votes, and results are visible on the blockchain for anyone to audit.</li>
            <li><strong>Global reach:</strong> People worldwide can coordinate quickly and pool resources without traditional barriers.</li>
            <li><strong>Code-enforced spending:</strong> Funds move only when agreed voting conditions are met, reducing the risk of unauthorized use.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Concentration of voting power:</strong> If a few members hold most tokens, they can dominate decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical vulnerabilities:</strong> Bugs in smart contracts can lead to large losses, as seen in the 2016 “The DAO” hack.</li>
            <li><strong>Coordination difficulties:</strong> Large, distributed groups may struggle to reach timely agreements.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal uncertainty:</strong> Many jurisdictions lack clear rules for DAOs, leaving questions about liability and compliance.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- ---------- RISKS & IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ---------- -->
        <section class="important-note">
          <h2>Risks &amp; Important Considerations</h2>

          <h3>Security &amp; Exploits</h3>
          <p>
            If a DAO’s smart contracts contain flaws, attackers can drain the treasury within minutes.
            Independent security audits help but cannot guarantee safety.
          </p>

          <h3>Governance Risks</h3>
          <p>
            Voting outcomes depend on active, informed participation.
            Low turnout or token concentration can enable a small group to pass harmful proposals.
          </p>

          <h3>Legal &amp; Regulatory Uncertainty</h3>
          <p>
            Some regions have begun offering legal frameworks for DAOs, but most have not.
            Participants may face unclear tax treatment or personal liability.
          </p>
