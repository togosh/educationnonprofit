        <!-- ---------- KEY TAKEAWAYS ---------- -->
        <section class="key-takeaways">
          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-executing code contracts:</strong> Smart contracts are programs on a blockchain that automatically carry out agreements when specific conditions are met. They run exactly as coded, without human intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>Trustless transactions:</strong> These contracts remove the need for a middleman (like a bank or lawyer) by enforcing rules with computer code. Parties can transact directly and confidently, without relying on a central authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Diverse use cases:</strong> Smart contracts power many applications—from creating tokens (cryptocurrencies and NFTs) to enabling decentralized finance platforms, blockchain gaming items, supply-chain tracking, and crowdfunding.</li>
            <li><strong>Risks of “code is law”:</strong> Smart contracts aren’t actually “smart.” Once deployed, they usually can’t be changed. Bugs or mistakes can lead to loss of funds with no easy way to recover them.</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ---------- 1. WHAT IS A SMART CONTRACT? ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>What Is a Smart Contract?</h2>
          <p><strong>Smart contracts</strong> are digital agreements written as code and stored on a blockchain. They self-execute when predetermined conditions are met. In simple terms, a smart contract acts like a computerized set of “if-then” instructions: <em>If</em> the required input or event is received, <em>then</em> the contract carries out the corresponding action.</p>

          <p>Smart contracts run on decentralized networks such as Ethereum, so no single person or company controls them. Once a smart contract is active on the blockchain, its terms generally can’t be altered, making it tamper-resistant and transparent.</p>

          <p><em>Analogy:</em> Think of a smart contract like a vending machine. You insert the correct amount and select an item; the machine automatically dispenses your snack. Similarly, a smart contract executes an agreement once its conditions are met—no clerk or broker needed.</p>

        <!-- ---------- 2. USE CASES OF SMART CONTRACTS ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>Use Cases of Smart Contracts</h2>
          <p>Here are common scenarios where smart contracts enforce rules automatically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Token Creation (Cryptocurrency &amp; NFTs):</strong> A contract defines a token’s properties and tracks ownership, ensuring uniqueness and secure transfers.</li>
            <li><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi):</strong> Lending, trading, and interest-earning platforms rely on contracts that hold collateral, release funds, and settle trades with no bank involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming (Provable Item Ownership):</strong> In-game assets become NFTs governed by contracts, so players truly own, trade, or sell their digital items.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply-Chain Automation:</strong> A contract can release payment automatically once delivery is confirmed, logging each shipment step on-chain.</li>
            <li><strong>Crowdfunding &amp; Charity:</strong> Funds stay locked until a goal is met; if the deadline passes without success, the contract refunds contributors automatically.</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ---------- 3. LIMITATIONS & RISKS OF SMART CONTRACTS ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>Limitations &amp; Risks of Smart Contracts</h2>
          <p>Despite their benefits, smart contracts have notable drawbacks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Not truly “smart” or legal:</strong> They only do what they’re coded to do and may not align with legal contract standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once deployed, code is hard to change. The 2016 “DAO hack” showed how a single bug can lead to millions lost.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliance on Oracles:</strong> Contracts need external data feeds (oracles) to know off-chain events, introducing trust and security risks.</li>
            <li><strong>No judgment or intent:</strong> A contract can’t interpret context; it will execute even if the outcome is unintended or unfair.</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ---------- 4. RISKS & IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ---------- -->
        <section class="important-note">
          <h2>Risks &amp; Important Considerations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>“Code is law” — irreversible actions:</strong> If a flaw exists, the blockchain will still execute it, and effects are usually permanent.</li>
            <li><strong>Not actually smart (or fair):</strong> Contracts blindly follow code, without flexibility or built-in dispute resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>No dispute resolution:</strong> Blockchain won’t mediate disagreements; outside legal action may be required.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational content — not financial advice:</strong> Examples illustrate concepts only and are not endorsements.</li>
            <li><strong>Bugs and exploits can be costly:</strong> Vulnerabilities have led to major losses; audits and caution are essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Need for audits and caution:</strong> Thorough testing and independent security reviews are critical before using or launching a contract.</li>
          </ul>
