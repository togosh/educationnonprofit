          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Blockchain search engine:</strong>
              A block explorer is a web tool that lets anyone view and verify data on a public
              blockchain. It’s like a search engine or browser for the blockchain, indexing every
              block, transaction, and address for easy lookup.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Search by TX, address, or block:</strong>
              Enter a transaction ID (hash), wallet address, or block number to view details such as
              sender/recipient, amount, fee, timestamp, and confirmation status.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Chain-specific tools:</strong>
              Each blockchain has its own explorers (e.g., Etherscan for Ethereum, Blockchain.com for
              Bitcoin). You cannot query Bitcoin data on an Ethereum explorer or vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verify and analyze transactions:</strong>
              Explorers help confirm whether a transaction is pending or finalized, and provide network
              data such as gas fees, latest blocks, and mempool size.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Public data &amp; privacy:</strong>
              Explorer results are fully public and pseudonymous. Never enter private keys, and always
              verify you are on a trusted site to avoid phishing.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ---------- 1. WHAT IS A BLOCK EXPLORER? ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>What Is a Block Explorer?</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>block explorer</strong> (or blockchain explorer) is an online application that allows
            anyone to browse and search the records stored on a blockchain. It pulls data directly
            from the public ledger and presents it in a human-readable format. Every block,
            transaction, and wallet address ever recorded is indexed and can be queried.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Analogy:</em>
            Think of the blockchain as a massive public library of all transactions. A block explorer
            is the library’s search catalog: you can look up any “book” by its index (a block or
            transaction ID) or any “author” by name (an address) and instantly read its contents.
          </p>

        <!-- ---------- 2. BASIC NAVIGATION ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>Basic Navigation – Transactions, Addresses, Blocks</h2>

          <h3>Transactions</h3>
          <p>
            Paste a transaction hash into the search bar to see its “receipt” on the blockchain:
            sender, recipient, amount, timestamp, fee, and current confirmation count. This is the
            fastest way to confirm that your transfer was included in a block.
          </p>

          <h3>Addresses (Wallets)</h3>
          <p>
            Entering a wallet address shows its current balance and complete transaction history.
            Many explorers also list any tokens (ERC-20, NFTs, etc.) held by that address. Keep in
            mind that anyone can view this information – blockchain transparency is a two-edged
            sword.
          </p>

          <h3>Blocks</h3>
          <p>
            Searching a block number (height) or block hash displays that block’s miner/validator,
            timestamp, size, and the list of all transactions it contains. Browsing recent blocks
            is a good way to see network activity in real time.
          </p>

        <!-- ---------- 3. ADVANCED USES & TIPS ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>Advanced Uses and Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Track confirmations:</strong>
              When waiting for a crypto deposit on an exchange, watch the confirmation counter to
              know when your funds are fully credited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monitor network congestion:</strong>
              Many explorers display pending transactions or current gas fees so you can decide
              whether to wait or pay a higher fee.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inspect smart contracts:</strong>
              On Ethereum explorers, you can read verified contract code and even interact with
              “read/write” functions (advanced users only).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Follow wallet activity:</strong>
              Analysts track “whale” wallets to see large transfers.  You can also export CSV data
              for taxes or research.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use multiple explorers:</strong>
              If one site is slow or offline, try an alternative (e.g., Blockchair for Bitcoin,
              Ethplorer for Ethereum) to cross-check results.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ---------- 4. RISKS & IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ---------- -->
        <section class="important-note">
          <h2>Risks &amp; Important Considerations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Verify the URL:</strong>
              Phishing sites imitate popular explorers. Check the domain (e.g., <em>etherscan.io</em>,
              <em>blockchain.com</em>) and ensure the connection is secured (HTTPS).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Read-only by default:</strong>
              Explorers should never ask for your private keys or seed phrase.  If a site requests
              them, leave immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confirmation depth:</strong>
              Treat transactions as final only after enough confirmations (e.g., six for Bitcoin)
              to protect against rare chain reorganizations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Privacy trade-offs:</strong>
              Querying your own address on a public explorer can link your IP to that address in
              the explorer’s logs.  For higher privacy, consider privacy-focused explorers or run
              your own node.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No fees required:</strong>
              Legitimate explorers are free for basic lookups.  If a site charges you just to see
              a transaction, it’s likely a scam.
            </li>
          </ul>
