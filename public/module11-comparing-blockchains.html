        <section class="key-takeaways">
          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Blockchains are shared ledgers:</strong>
              Think of a blockchain as a public notebook that many computers keep
              identical copies of. Everyone sees the same history of transactions,
              which builds trust without a central authority.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design choices create trade-offs:</strong>
              Bitcoin focuses on being “digital gold,” while Ethereum acts as a
              programmable world computer. Each chain optimizes for different goals,
              so no single blockchain is best at everything.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Speed vs. decentralization:</strong>
              Newer chains like Solana aim for very high transaction speeds and low
              fees, but they often rely on smaller validator sets. Older chains such
              as Bitcoin and Ethereum sacrifice speed to maximize openness and
              security.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Public vs. private networks:</strong>
              Public blockchains are open to anyone, while private (permissioned)
              blockchains restrict access to known participants. Each model suits
              different use cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Framework for comparison:</strong>
              When you hear about a new blockchain, ask about its consensus method,
              throughput, fees, decentralization level, governance model, and real-
              world track record.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ---------- CASE STUDY 1 ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>Case Study 1 — Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Different Aims, Different Tech</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> Bitcoin was created to be an independent form of
            money and long-term store of value. Ethereum was designed as a platform
            for running smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Consensus &amp; security:</strong> Bitcoin relies on
            <em>Proof-of-Work</em> mining, which is energy-intensive and produces a
            new block roughly every ten minutes. Ethereum now uses
            <em>Proof-of-Stake</em>, where validators lock up (stake) ETH and create
            new blocks about every twelve seconds. PoS is far more energy-efficient
            but involves different security assumptions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Supply &amp; economics:</strong> Bitcoin has a hard cap of
            21 million coins, making its supply predictable and scarce. Ether (ETH)
            does not have a fixed cap; instead, Ethereum introduced fee “burning”
            that can reduce supply when network activity is high. Each policy reflects
            its community’s philosophy.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Transaction capability:</strong> Bitcoin’s base layer mainly
            handles simple BTC transfers. Ethereum’s base layer executes many kinds
            of transactions (smart-contract calls) but charges <em>gas fees</em>
            that rise when the network is busy.
          </p>

              alt="Infographic comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum" class="blockchain-diagram-image"/>

          <p>
            <em>Bottom line:</em> Bitcoin excels at simplicity and scarcity; Ethereum
            excels at flexibility and programmability. Each made deliberate choices
            that suit different goals.
          </p>

        <!-- ---------- CASE STUDY 2 ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>Case Study 2 — Alternative Ecosystems</h2>

          <h3>Ethereum vs. Solana</h3>
          <p>
            Solana targets very high throughput (tens of thousands of transactions
            per second) using a hybrid <em>Proof-of-History + Proof-of-Stake</em>
            approach. This speed supports fast games and real-time trading, but it
            requires powerful hardware and has resulted in several temporary
            outages. Ethereum remains slower but more decentralized and
            battle-tested, with a much larger developer community.
          </p>

          <img src="/images/module11_ethereumvssolana.jpg"
              alt="Chart comparing Ethereum and Solana performance" class="blockchain-diagram-image"/>

          <h3>Public vs. Private (Permissioned) Blockchains</h3>
          <p>
            Public networks (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) allow anyone to read data and
            help secure the chain. Private or consortium chains (e.g., Hyperledger
            Fabric, Quorum) restrict participation to known entities, trading some
            decentralization for higher speed, privacy, and regulatory compliance—
            useful for business supply chains or inter-bank settlement.
          </p>

              alt="Diagram contrasting public and private blockchains" class="blockchain-diagram-image"/>

          <p>
            <em>Takeaway:</em> Different problems call for different blockchain
            designs. Speed, privacy, and openness exist on a sliding scale.

        <!-- ---------- COMPARISON FRAMEWORK ---------- -->
        <section>
          <h2>Framework for Comparing Any Blockchain</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Consensus mechanism:</strong> PoW, PoS, or something else?
              Affects energy use, security assumptions, and openness.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transaction throughput &amp; fees:</strong> How many
              transactions per second and at what cost?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Smart-contract support:</strong> Can it run complex code or
              only simple transfers?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ecosystem maturity:</strong> Size of developer community,
              number of users, and availability of tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security track record:</strong> Years in operation, history of
              hacks or critical failures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decentralization metrics:</strong> Number and geographic
              spread of validators or miners.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Governance model:</strong> Community-driven or foundation-led?
              How are upgrades decided?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unique features:</strong> Privacy layers, interoperability,
              on-chain identity, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <!-- ---------- RISKS & IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ---------- -->
        <section class="important-note">
          <h2>Risks &amp; Important Considerations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Irreversibility:</strong> Mistakes and hacks on blockchains are
              usually permanent; there is no “undo” button.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security vulnerabilities:</strong> Smart contracts and
              cross-chain bridges can contain bugs that attackers exploit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trade-offs are inevitable:</strong> Faster, cheaper networks
              may be less decentralized or more prone to outages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ecosystems evolve:</strong> Upgrades can change performance and
              economics over time—always check the latest information.
