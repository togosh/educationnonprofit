      <section class="key-takeaways">
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Digital assets are items of value that exist purely in digital form (e.g., cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins, NFTs).</li>
          <li>Ownership and transfers are recorded on blockchains—shared digital ledgers visible to all participants.</li>
          <li>You can acquire digital assets via exchanges, as payment, or by mining/earning them; they are stored in wallets that protect your private keys.</li>
          <li>Transactions involve signing messages with your private key and paying a small network fee; confirmations are recorded on-chain.</li>
          <li>Major risks include extreme price volatility, scams, theft, loss of private keys, and evolving regulations. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 1. What Are Digital Assets? -->
      <section>
        <h2>What Are Digital Assets? (Cryptocurrency & Beyond)</h2>
        <p>A <strong>digital asset</strong> is anything valuable that exists only in digital form. Examples range from everyday files (like photos) to blockchain-based assets:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong> – digital money such as Bitcoin or Ether.</li>
          <li><strong>Tokens</strong> – units issued on existing blockchains that can represent utility, governance rights, or shares in a project.</li>
          <li><strong>Stablecoins</strong> – cryptocurrencies designed to track the value of a stable asset (such as one US dollar).</li>
          <li><strong>NFTs</strong> (Non-Fungible Tokens) – unique tokens often used for digital art or collectibles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unlike physical cash or gold, these assets have no tangible form. Instead, a blockchain—think of it as a shared digital notebook—records who owns what. Because the notebook is copied across thousands of computers, tampering is extremely difficult.</p>

      <!-- 2. How to Acquire and Store Digital Assets -->
      <section>
        <h2>How to Acquire and Store Digital Assets</h2>

        <h3>Common Ways to Acquire</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Buy on an exchange:</strong> Use dollars (or other currency) to purchase crypto on a regulated platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Accept as payment or gift:</strong> Receive crypto from another person or business.</li>
          <li><strong>Earn or mine:</strong> Contribute computing power or services and be rewarded in tokens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wallets &amp; Private Keys</h3>
        <p>A <strong>wallet</strong> is software or hardware that stores your <em>private keys</em>—secret codes proving ownership. </p>
        <p><em>Analogy:</em> If the blockchain is a public mailbox, your private key is the only key that can open your personal slot. Lose it, and you lose access forever.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Custodial wallet:</strong> A third-party service (like an exchange) holds the keys on your behalf—convenient, but you must trust them.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-custody wallet:</strong> You hold your own keys, often using a hardware device kept offline. Ultimate control, but full responsibility.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 3. Using Digital Assets in Transactions -->
      <section>
        <h2>Using Digital Assets in Transactions</h2>
        <p>Sending cryptocurrency is like emailing value:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Your wallet creates a message: “Send X coins to address Y.”</li>
          <li>You sign the message with your private key (proving authorization).</li>
          <li>The network verifies the signature and adds the transaction to the next block.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A small <strong>transaction fee</strong> (often called <em>gas</em>) pays validators for processing. Confirmations can take seconds to minutes, depending on network congestion.</p>
        <p>Many people hold crypto instead of spending it due to price swings—values rise and fall quickly. Others use crypto debit cards, online merchants, or peer-to-peer transfers for everyday spending.</p>

      <!-- 4. Risks & Important Considerations -->
      <section class="important-note">
        <h2>Risks & Important Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Prices can change by double-digit percentages within hours. You could lose your entire investment.</li>
          <li><strong>Security:</strong> Losing a private key means permanent loss. Online services can be hacked or go bankrupt.</li>
          <li><strong>Scams &amp; Fraud:</strong> Phishing emails, fake tokens, and Ponzi schemes are common. Verify everything.</li>
          <li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> Laws vary by country and can change quickly. Tax reporting is required in many jurisdictions.</li>
          <li><strong>No Implicit Endorsements:</strong> Mentions of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any platform are for illustration only—LIFT does not recommend any specific asset.</li>
        </ul>
