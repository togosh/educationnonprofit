                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Digital Future Education Alliance of Texas (DFEAT) empowers people with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and safely engage with emerging digital technologies. Through accessible courses, clear printed guides, community workshops, and open online resources, we foster digital literacy regarding distributed-ledger systems, decentralized networks, and other novel digital assets.</p>

                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>We envision a Texas where all individuals have the opportunity to develop a clear understanding of the digital technologies shaping their future, enabling informed participation and critical thinking in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>

                <h2>Our Approach to Education</h2>
                <p>DFEAT is committed to providing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective Information:</strong> Presenting factual content without hype or speculation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessible Learning:</strong> Creating resources that are easy to understand for a broad audience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive Understanding:</strong> Covering the fundamentals, potential applications, and important considerations (including risks) of the technologies we discuss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Focus:</strong> Tailoring our efforts to benefit the people of Texas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our educational materials may use specific platforms or technologies (such as HEX, PulseChain, PulseX, Bitcoin, Ethereum) as case studies or examples to illustrate broader concepts within distributed ledger technology and digital assets. This is always done from a neutral, comparative, and educational standpoint, not as an endorsement or promotion of any specific asset for investment purposes.</p>

                <h2>Our Team (Board of Directors)</h2>
                <p>DFEAT is led by a dedicated volunteer board committed to our educational mission:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stephen [Last Name]</strong> - President & Treasurer (Briefly state commitment to digital education - no financial success stories)</li>
                    <li><strong>Davin [Last Name]</strong> - Secretary (Briefly state commitment to community and learning)</li>
                    <li><strong>Victor [Last Name]</strong> - Director (Briefly state interest in future technologies and education)</li>
                </ul>
